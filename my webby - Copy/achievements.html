              <h3>Achievement One: The epic</h3>
              <p>
                The Epic, a 16-day school-run excursion to the Cederberg, comprised a 6-day and a 4-day hike, along with
                6 days of other activities.
                Throughout the hiking, we had to carry all our sustenance, resulting in a backpack weighing around 17kg.
                Hiking around 20km a day, with a highly fit group, I fell severely behind and negative thoughts clouded
                my mind. I thought of ways to quit and did not think it was possible to make it through the Epic.
                However, I kept pushing, and walked in the front to maintain the pace. This taught me a valuable lesson
                - if you are in front, you gain the confidence to push further and harder. In life, one must have
                self-confidence even if slightly skewed, as this will cause you to act in a way to achieve your beliefs.
                I also learned to focus solely on the next step, instead of the daunting end goal. A differential amount
                of progress will in time lead to magnificent goals. Using this new found confidence and lessons I
                achieved perhaps my most personal achievement. Near the end of the hike, an optional and challenging
                peak was offered. Tafelberg, standing at 1996m stood in front of me. I had no choice but to push myself
                to my my limits. I climbed with pace and ease, summating the mountain and looking over the vast expanse
                of the Cederberg. This was a moment of pure bliss and achievement. Aside from the hiking, I enjoyed
                activities including braais, getting to know new people, community service, water skiing, and canoeing.
                The 16 days without a phone, completely surrounded by raw nature, although involving the worst of my
                suffering, was in truth the best I have ever felt. This lead to my sheer love for hiking and camping.

              <h3>Achievement Two: Gold Presidents Award</h3>
              <p>

                This award involved a rigorous and multifaceted process, progressing from the bronze to the gold level.
                To meet the requirements, I dedicated approximately 200 hours to community service.
                Additionally, I actively participated in programs designed to push me beyond my comfort zone and foster
                personal growth.
                These included sports tours and a challenging excursion called the Epic. I also engaged in various
                physical activities such as sailing, canoeing, hockey, soccer, and tennis. This program guided me along
                a path of service and exiting my comfort zone. As such I learnt the importance of even the smallest
                amount of help as well as growing the conidence to do so.

              <h3>Achievement Three: Side Businesses</h3>
              <p>
                During my residence at Simonsberg, Stellenbosch, I decided to take a few risks and start a few
                businesses. The first was selling energy drinks to my fellow students. This proved to be popular
                especially in the exam season. I learned that high demand products are always a safe bet. However,
                margins are low and demand is seasonal and not high enough for this to be profitable long-term. Next, I
                made patches for our residence floor to be worn on our khakis. Although the aim was not profit, I spend
                a lot of time learning about what others would like to see, leveraging this in my design, and marketing
                it door to door to ensure sufficient sales. Finally, I started a perfume selling business. I was the
                demand for cheap perfumes picking up in stores all around the country. I decided to research higher
                quality but still affordable perfumes. These met the criteria of a non-synethic and unique smell, large
                projection area, and long-lasting smell, allowing me to operate with the benefits of premium perfumes
                but close to the low-quality perfume price range. I took high quality photos and marketed it to groups
                and reached over 1000 people. However, this was a lesson hard learnt as I did not receive high
                conversions on messages and of the people who did sample the perfume, it was either too much of a
                statement or they were not really serious about buying a perfume. This lesson taught me that selling
                products that are more niche comes with a risk and you need a very large audience to make it profitable
                and different 'flavors' of products are needed.

              <h3>Achievement Four: Odd electrical Jobs</h3>
              <p>
                This achievement pays testament to my continued passion for electrical engineering. During my residence
                time, side quests never failed to tickle my interest and provide small senses of achievements. This
                involved fixing of strip lights, turning switches on and off at the distribution board causing frantic
                roars from sparking appliances, allowing me to pinpoint the root cause of the trips. Further these
                involved fixing of charging cables, and using foil and some knowledge to to provide just enough power,
                albeit from unintended power sources, to power some small devices.

              <h3>Achievement Five: Woodwork</h3>
              <p>
                A passion to create led me into woodwork. The first main project I did was building a skateboard rack.
                This rack needed to hold my single skateboard vertically up, to ensure space efficiency, and display the
                board's fine finish to the world. Using moment and gravity analysis I was able to self-design the rack,
                placing strengthening planks in the right places to ensure the rack would not collapse. I positioned the
                main holder in the right spot, accounting for the tilt of the board in the secure groove, to ensure the
                stand had no leaning tendencies. Overall, the rack worked and looked great. My next project involved
                making a fully packable wooden rocking chair. This design was found online but that unfortunately did
                not implicate an easy build. Each piece of wood was required to be in an ellipse shape. With my limited
                tools, drawing and cutting an ellipse of this size and ensuring all pieces were similarly sizes was not
                easy. Keeping the edges rounded involved numerous rounds of sanding considering the jigsaw lacked the
                required accuracy. Overall, the chair was a success, allowing free rocking in a comfortable position.
