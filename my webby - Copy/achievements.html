          <h3>Side businesses</h3>
          
            <p>

            
            During my residence at Simonsberg, Stellenbosch, I ensured I keep busy with many side projects. This started with identifying and acting on the large demand for caffeine amongst students. My services involved selling energy drinks well under the exorbitant residence prices and supplying a temporal and spatial convenience. Although in high demand, I realized margins and scalability were too low for this to be worthwhile.

             Another project involved designing and outsourcing the making of patches for our residence floor to be with our khaki jackets. Although not aiming to profit, this involved understanding the customer base and what they want from the product, ensuring quality, ensuring the design was sufficiently simple to comply with patch resolutions, and marketing it to the floor. This project was a success, with all patches being sold and worn by the floor.

             A larger project of mine involved bulk buying and selling good-quality, affordable perfumes. At that time, there were cheap perfumes being sold, however, they used questionable ingredients and the performance, smell, and projection were poor. I noticed how another business did well in selling higher quality, yet still affordable, perfumes. With this information I did extensive research into some of the most popular 'clone' fragrances that performed well, smelled natural and close to their premium counterparts, and yet still sufficiently affordable. I picked out a strong and opulent scent and decided to invest in a bulk order. I took high quality photos and marketed it to groups and reached over 1000 people. However, conversion rates on groups were low, and in-person conversion rates were higher but still sub-par, with feedback mainly including how the scent is too intense and unwelcoming. I learnt that certain products are more suited for hard or in person sales, that I need variety as not everybody has the same preferences as me, and that I need to more extensively research and understand my customer base.

          <h3>Gold Presidents Award</h3>
          <p>This award involved a rigorous and multifaceted process, progressing from the bronze to the gold level.
            To meet the requirements, I dedicated approximately 200 hours to community service, 
            and participated in programs that fostered personal growth. This included the Epic as well as meeting sporting activities such as sailing, canoeing, hockey, soccer, and tennis. This achievement game me perspective on the world around me, the different kinds of people, and a burning desire to be the change I want to see in the world.

          <h3>The Epic</h3>
          
            <p>
              
            The Epic, a 16-day excursion to the Cederberg, comprised of 10 days of unforgiving hiking. Carrying 18kg of sustenance for 20-25 km a day with an experienced group, I fell behind. My mind was riddled with negativity about not being able to make it. However, this all changed when I was put in the front of the group and decided to begin my hikes before the rest of the group. Further, I decided to stop looking ahead, literally, and focused purely on my next step to avoid becoming overwhelmed. This allowed me to flourish and gain unimaginable growth in ability. Near the end, I peaked Tafelberg, standing at 1996m and being completely optional. In fact, my group even struggled to keep up with me at times. Pure bliss filled my heart and without a trace of technology, I truly felt alive.
            
            </p>
            <p> 
            Through this achievement I learnt two very valuable lessons. Firstly, one must have unwavering self-confidence. Through this, one tears down the notions of what is possible and what is not and acts in a way that pushes them in the direction of maximal growth. Secondly, one must focus on the next step, not the daunting mountain ahead. By focusing simply on the next step, with consistency, one can achieve magnificent goals.

          <h3>Woodwork</h3>
          <p>A passion to create led me into woodwork. The first main project I did was building a skateboard rack.
            This rack needed to hold my single skateboard vertically up, to ensure space efficiency, and display the
            board's finish. Analyzing the moments and forces associated with the design, I was able to design the placement of the holder as well as subtle supporting pieces. Another project involved making a fully packable wooden rocking chair. The design involved four ellipse-shaped pieces, which slotted in together to form the chair. Through painting, jigsawing, and sanding, I was able to create a chair which rocked freely, was comfortable, and could be very quickly packed away. </p>
